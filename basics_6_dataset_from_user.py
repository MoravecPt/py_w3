#list je ve hranatych zavorkach, tuple v kulatych
# Python list:
#
# A list is a container which holds comma separated values (items or elements)
# between square brackets where items or elements need not all have the same type. In general, we can define a
# list as an object that contains multiple data items (elements). The contents of a list can be changed during
# program execution. The size of a list can also change during execution, as elements are added or removed from it.
#
# Python tuple:
#
# A tuple is container which holds a
# series of comma separated values (items or elements)
# between parentheses such as an (x, y) co-ordinate. Tuples 
# are like lists, except they are immutable (i.e. you cannot change its content once created)
# and can hold mix data types.
